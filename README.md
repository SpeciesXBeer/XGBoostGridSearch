# XGBoostGridSearch
This is an extremely cut and dry code for an example of utilizing grid search to 
discover the optimal parameters of XGBoost to use on inference of a single column (regression).


Note: There is no 80/20 split on this (training/test) and no visualizations. Make sure to include these when 
you are running experiments.  The reason behind this was to show the bare bones of the algorithm in action.
